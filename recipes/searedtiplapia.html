    <p>This is a quick and simple recipe that anyone can enjoy. This recipe has some suggested seasoning but you have a lot more freedom of choice in this one.</p>
    <p>Tilapia is a rather tasty and inexpensive fish, it takes on whatever you season or couple the dish with, so a vegetable like broccoli can go very far if seasoned correctly and paired with this meal.</p>

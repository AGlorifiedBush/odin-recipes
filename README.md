# odin-recipes

This project goes over basic HTML practices
The task was to make a recipe page 
Trying out the basic HTML "!DOCTYPYE" layout
Using OL and UL to make Ordered and Unordered Lists
Building 3 recipes with images to really flush out my skills
Through this I should have a better understanding of how HTML is structured
